# Finite Automaton Visualizer 🎯

A web-based finite automaton (FA) visualizer built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This tool allows users to:

- Create deterministic finite automata (DFA) interactively
- Add/delete states, transitions, start and accept states
- Simulate input strings step-by-step
- Highlight current active state(s)
- Reset the automaton or simulation flow

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Canvas**: Click/tap to create new states; drag between states to create transitions.
- **State Management**: Toggle start/accept states and delete states or transitions.
- **Simulation Interface**: Enter an input string, simulate execution one character at a time, and observe transitions and active states.
- **Reset & Clear**: Instantly clear the canvas or restart exactly from configured states.
- **User-friendly UI**: Simple, approachable interface ideal for teaching or understanding automata theory.
